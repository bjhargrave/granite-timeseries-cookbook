# Granite Timeseries Cookbook

We'll start by implementing "recipe" forms of these TS notebooks: https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/tree/main/notebooks.

How do we prioritize which ones to do first?
* Most relevant use cases for industry.
* Easiest to get done.
* Good datasets already exist.

For information about contributing to this repo, code of conduct guidelines, etc., see the [community](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/community) project.
